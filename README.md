# 🚀 SmartRes AI: Professional Resume Analyzer
SmartRes AI is an intelligent career tool designed to bridge the gap between job seekers and recruiters. By leveraging the Google Gemini 1.5 Flash model, it provides deep, ATS-style analysis to help candidates optimize their resumes for specific job descriptions.

## 🌟 Key Features
- **ATS-Style Scoring:** Instant rating out of 10 based on JD relevance.
- **Strict 2-Line Summary:** High-impact professional summaries designed to pass human screening.
- **Skill Gap Analysis:** Highlights specific missing keywords and technologies.
- **Actionable Task:** Provides a single, high-priority task to improve the resume score to 8/10 or higher.
- **Smart Model Fallback:** Built-in technical redundancy to ensure uptime.


🧠 How It Works
Text Extraction: The app uses PyPDF2 to read and parse content from uploaded PDF resumes.

AI Alignment: It sends the resume text and the target Job Description (JD) to the Gemini AI.

Intelligent Evaluation: The AI evaluates the match based on keywords, project relevance, and industry standards.

Feedback Loop: The app returns a score, a gap analysis, and a specific "Action Task" to improve the resume.
